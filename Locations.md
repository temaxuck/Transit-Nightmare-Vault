# Parking lot

This is where the game starts. This is an **endless liminal space**. It's **foggy**, **misty**. It is night. **Player** can **wander** on this parking lot **forever**. Every time player reaches side of this location, they seamlessly teleport to other side. This effect creates an illusion of an endless parking lot.
