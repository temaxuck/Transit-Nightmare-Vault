# Player
#protagonist

The main character is kind of faceless. It is just nobody, so that the actual player can relate to themselves. 
# Monster Car
#antagonist

*Alive soulful* monster car. It is crazy, main purpose of this character is to scare the shit out of the player (just as most of NPCs in this game). 

It controls the whole [[Locations#Subway station|subway station]]. It's voice talks to a player in the speakers and guides them throughout the station.

It is **final boss**.
## Voice

It can **speak**. Probably the only character who is going to be voiced in the game (the rest characters' speech is going to be presented in the form of subtitles; **\[To be approved]**). If this was a person, this would be a **schizophrenic**, insane guy, who would start **yelling abruptly**. Most of the time it's voice is **calm**, but **hurried** at the same time (consider compare to [Portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)) Wheatley's voice, but maybe even more sudden). 

- "KEY!!! TAKE THE KEY!!!"
- "WHY ARE YOU STAYING?! HURRY UP!!!"
- "MOVE, MOVE"
## Visual Design

It **is 70-80's era American** made **auto**, something like an old dodge / chevy car.
It is **rusty**. 
It should be **boxy**, bulky;
